title: Introducing Kyle's new blog
---

Intro Post until I can get better content formed this week.  Maybe try the 30 posts for 30 days a bit late... who knows I can start by where I found all my code for this site.

### Built on GitHub

I always looked into [WordPress Blogs](http://wordpress.com) however I never wanted to pay to host a small site I felt would get little activity.  That left me to go find a new way to post that wasn't blogger related.  The Jekyll GitHub movement sounded like an interesting and more importantly free and useful learning tool.
